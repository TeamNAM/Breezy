# Breezy
Codepath Group Project

## Description
Breezy makes weather about *you*. In cities like San Francisco with microclimates and varying conditions, reading through weather reports is tedious and hard. And, many people forget to do it: ending up drenched, freezing or sweating. We want to prevent that by learning which places you care about and giving you simple suggestions for what to wear or bring—integrating weather and your morning routine into one easy step.
